# random-password-generator
A project designed to create a random password for the user. The user is asked questions to determine the criteria the password will have, including the length of the password, which can be between 8 and 128 characters, and whether the password will contain uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. The password is then displayed to the text area. This project emphasized using Javascript to dynamically change HTML, in addition to other Javascript abilities, such as random generation.
